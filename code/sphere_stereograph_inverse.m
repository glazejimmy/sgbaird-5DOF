function p = sphere_stereograph_inverse ( q )

%% SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_INVERSE computes stereographic preimages of points.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    We start with a sphere of radius 1 and center (0,0,0).
%
%    The north pole N = (0,0,1) is the point of tangency to the sphere 
%    of a plane, and the south pole S = (0,0,-1) is the focus for the 
%    stereographic projection.
%
%    For any point Q on the plane, the stereographic inverse projection
%    P of the point is defined by drawing the line from S through Q, and 
%    computing P as the intersection of this line with the sphere.
%
%    Actually, we allow the spatial dimension M to be arbitrary.  Values
%    of M make sense starting with 2.  The north and south poles are
%    selected as the points (0,0,...,+1) and (0,0,...,-1).
