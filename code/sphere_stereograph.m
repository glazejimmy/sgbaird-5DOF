function q = sphere_stereograph ( p )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH computes the stereographic image of points on a sphere.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    We start with a sphere of radius 1 and center (0,0,0).
%
%    The north pole N = (0,0,1) is the point of tangency to the sphere 
%    of a plane, and the south pole S = (0,0,-1) is the focus for the 
%    stereographic projection.
%
%    For any point P on the sphere, the stereographic projection Q of the
%    point is defined by drawing the line from S through P, and computing
%    Q as the intersection of this line with the plane.
%
%    Actually, we allow the spatial dimension M to be arbitrary.  Values
%    of M make sense starting with 2.  The north and south poles are
%    selected as the points (0,0,...,+1) and (0,0,...,-1).
